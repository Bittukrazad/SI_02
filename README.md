Image Classification Of Butterfly Using a Pre-trained CNN

This project involves building an image classification model to identify different species of butterflies using deep learning techniques with TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset contains butterfly images from various classes, organized into training and testing sets.

Key Components:

Dataset Preparation:

The dataset consists of 12594 training images and 500 testing images, spanning 100 different butterfly classes.
Images are preprocessed and resized to a standard dimension of 180x180 pixels with RGB color channels.

Model Development:

The model utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for image classification.
TensorFlowâ€™s image preprocessing module is used to load and preprocess the dataset from directories, ensuring that images are standardized before feeding them into the model.

Training and Testing:

The training dataset is used to train the model, while the testing dataset evaluates its performance across various butterfly classes.
The notebook provides information on different butterfly species, such as "MONARCH," "BLUE MORPHO," and "ZEBRA LONG WING," among others.
